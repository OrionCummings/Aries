# â™ˆ The Aries Project

The Aries Project encompasses four components: the Aries Programming Language, the Aries Assembly Language, the Aries Hardware Emulator, and the Aries Computer. All four components aim to be non-trivial explorations into the domains of programming language development and theory, electrical and computer engineering, and embedded software development and testing.
